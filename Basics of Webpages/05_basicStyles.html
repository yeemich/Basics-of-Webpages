        /* 
        
        This is one of the other ways you can add styles in HTML.
        As you can see, I have put a "style" tag inside of the "head" tag to do this.
        The style tag treats all the text within it as CSS code.

        To add a style in a "style" tag, it's quite simple


        (What you'd like to change the style of)
        {
            styles...
        }


        That's all. Now you can add styles in a style tag.

        */

        p /*All p tags in this file*/
        {
            background-color: burlywood;
        }

        /* 
        If two different things are trying to style the same elements,
        It'll use the more specific style to the tag.
        (To be more accurate, its which ever one has the parent)
         */

        div p /*All p tags in a div tag in this file*/
        {
            background-color: aqua;
        }

        /*
        In this case, for the p tags which are in a div, (div p) is more specific than (p) so
        those ones will have a background color of aqua.
        If a p tag isn't in a div however, it doesn't meet the requirements of (div p) so
        those one will have a background color of burlywood.
        */

        ul li /*All li tags in a ul tag in this file*/
        {
            background-color: rgb(255, 255, 125);
        }

        span /*All span tags in this file*/
        {
            background-color: greenyellow;
        }

        body /*The body tag*/
        {
            background-color: cornsilk;
        }

        /* Those are the basics of the pure CSS code in a style tag but we'll further into it later. */

    <h1 style="display: inline; background-color: burlywood;">Basic Styles</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        In this file, we'll be going over several basic styles to look at and use.
        Make sure that before continuing, you <span>read the comments in the "style" tag</span> I added for
        the first time <span> in the "head" tag </span> above.
    </p>

    <p>The different styles we'll be going over are...</p>
    <ol style="background-color: burlywood;">
        <li>Color</li>

        <li>Text-Decoration</li>

        <li>Font-Style</li>
        <li>Font-Weight</li>
        <li>Font-Size (and CSS units)</li>
        <li>Font-Family</li>
        <li>Font</li>

    </ol>

    <p>Let's begin</p>

    <hr>

    <p style="color:crimson">1. Color: Changes the color of the text within a tag. We've already gone
    over all the ways which someone can write a color in CSS so we won't do it again but they all work.
    for everytag, including this one.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>
        2. Text-Decoration: allows you to change how the text's decoration (the underline, overline or line-through) looks.
        The first step is deciding wether you want underlined, overlined, line-through or any combination of them.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline;">Underlined</li>
        <li style="text-decoration: overline;">OverLined (this overline is completly separate from the underline above)</li>
        <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">Line-Through</li>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline overline line-through;">All</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Once you specify that, you can set the what you would like each line to look.
        I'll use only underlines to show you.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline dashed;">Underline Dashed</li>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline solid;">Underline Solid</li>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline dotted;">Underline Dotted</li>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline wavy;">Underline Wavy</li>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline double;">Underilne Double</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Then, we can add a color onto the end of it to specify the color of the line</p>

    <ul>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline solid red;">Underline Solid Red</li>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline solid green;">Underline Solid Green</li>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline solid blue;">Underline Solid Blue</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can also assign each of those values individually using</p>

    <p style="
    text-decoration-line: underline overline;
    text-decoration-style: double;
    text-decoration-color: yellow;">
        text-decoration-line, text-decoration-style and Text-Decoration-Color
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p>Let's talk about Fonts now.</p>

    <p style="font-style: italic;">
        3. Font-Style: Changes the style of the text. The other styles are...
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-style: oblique;">Font-Style: Oblique</li>
        <li style="font-style: normal;">Font-Style: Normal</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">
        4. Font-Weight: The boldness/weight of the text. You can set this two different ways
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Name</dt>
        <dd style="font-weight: lighter;">Font-Weight: Lighter</dd>
        <dd style="font-weight: normal;">Font-Weight: Normal</dd>
        <dd style="font-weight: bold;">Font-Weight: Bold</dd>
        <dd style="font-weight: bolder;">Font-Weight: Bolder</dd>
        <dt>Number</dt>
        <dd style="font-weight: 100;">Font-Weight: 100</dd>
        <dd style="font-weight: 300;">Font-Weight: 300</dd>
        <dd style="font-weight: 500;">Font-Weight: 500</dd>
        <dd style="font-weight: 700;">Font-Weight: 700</dd>
        <dd style="font-weight: 900;">Font-Weight: 900</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        If you don't see a difference between all the other weights, it's most
        likley that the font used doesn't support it past "bold" and "not bold"
        If you needed more weights for whatever reason, you would need to pick a new font.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: xx-large;">
        5.1. Font-Size: changes the size the the font. there are 2 way you can set the font size.
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Name</dt>
        <dd style="font-size: small;">small</dd>
        <dd style="font-size: medium;">medium</dd>
        <dd style="font-size: large;">large</dd>
        <dd style="font-size: x-large;">x-large</dd>
        <dt>Number (units)</dt>
    </dl>

    <p>
        We need to go into a mini lesson on units before explaining
        how to set the font-size with a Number
    </p>

    <div style="background-color: darkgrey;">
        <h2 style="display: inline; background-color: burlywood;">5.2. Units</h2>
        <p>There are a number of different units so I'll quickly go over all of them quickly.</p>
        <p>Let's start with the fixed units which don't change in length.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>cm (centimeters)</li>
            <li>mm (millimeters)</li>
            <li>in (inches)</li>
            <li>px (pixels)</li>
            <li>pt (<a href="https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/199/point-vs-pixel-what-is-the-difference">point</a>)</li>
            <li>pc (<a href="https://www.fonts.com/content/learning/fontology/level-1/type-anatomy/points-and-picas">picas</a>)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Of those units, the main one to remember would be px, the other ones are not often used.</p>
        <p>The next set of units are relative units which do change in length.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_pxtoemconversion.asp">em</a>  (current font-size)</li>
            <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/918612/what-is-the-value-of-the-css-ex-unit">ex</a> (height of a lowercase 'x' character)</li>
            <li><a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2018/06/28/what-is-the-css-ch-unit/">ch</a> (width of the '0' character of current font-size)</li>
            <li>rem (font-size of the "html" tag)</li>
            <li>vw (1% of the width of the webpage/veiwport)</li>
            <li>vh (1% of the height of the webpage/veiwport)</li>
            <li>vmin (1% of the webpage's/veiwport's smaller dimesion. ex: phone:width, tv:height)</li>
            <li>vmax (1% of the webpage's/veiwport's bigger dimesion. ex: phone:height, tv:width)</li>
            <li>% (relative to the dimesions of the parent/container element</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Of these units, the main ones to remember are em, vw, vh and %.
        </p>

        <p>
            Those are all the units of CSS. If you can remember just those main 5 I said, you should be good
            to do 99% of the dimesioning you need to do for your website. If you want to go into a bit more
            detail about the units, you can check out
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp">w3school's page on CSS units</a> or
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/units.en.html">the pdf on CSS units by w3</a>.
            Both are very helpful and to good to look at for any extra needed clarity on CSS units.
        </p>

    </div>

    <p>
        Now we can go back to font-size. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Anything that accepts a length in CSS will
        allow you to use any of these units</span> which also includes font-size. I would show you all the differnet
        units but a lot of them have no paratical use when it comes font-size. I will just show you how to do it with the
        pixel (px) units but know that if you wanted to use the other ones, they would work.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 50px;">This the font size at 50px</p>

    <p>Now let's move on to the rest of the styles.</p>

    <hr>

    <p style="font-family: Lucida Sans, Lucida Sans Regular, Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans Unicode, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
        6. Font-Family: Let's you pick the font you want.
        In case a device doesn't have the font you want, it's best to put your font-family as
        a list of possible fonts that you would be ok with the computer displaying in case they don't have the your first font.
        At the end of the list, you should put a few common fonts in which you know will work with most devices that you would like.
        For a list of common fonts that will work close to 100% of the time, go to <a href="https://websitesetup.org/web-safe-fonts-html-css/">this site here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        7. Font: We can use the this style to set the
        size, weight and family (in that order) of a font all at once.
        I don't think it's too hard to figure it out so I'll just show
        you an example of how you would use it.
    </p>

    <!--            size weight family  
                     \/    \/     \/           -->
    <p style="font: large bold Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
        Here's a paragraph which has been set to a font size of "large",
        a font weight of "bold", the font family of Arial and given
        the option to fallback on Helvetica or sans-serif if the device doesn't have
        the Arial font (which a surprising amount of devices don't have actually).
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p>
        That will conclude the end of this file. in the next file, we'll
        go over some more styles next file and finish up with the basics
        of CSS. Good luck and have fun.
