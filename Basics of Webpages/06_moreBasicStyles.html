        More Basic Styles
    </h1>

    <hr>
    
    <p>
        In this file, we'll go over the rest of the basic styles
        which you should know in CSS. Similar to the last file, you should
        make sure to <span style="font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">read what's in the style tag above</span>
        to see why everything on the page has the style it has.
    </p>



    <ol>
        <li>Height</li>

        <li>Width</li>
        
        <li>Margin</li>
        
        <li>Padding</li>

        <li>Border</li>

        <li>Text-Align</li>
        
        <li>Float</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Now let's step away from fonts for a bit.</p>

    <p style="height: 90px;">1. height: sets the height of any non-inline element.
    This one is set to 90px</p>
    
    <p style="width: 300px;">2. width: sets the width of any non-inline element.
    This one is set to 300px</p>

    <p>
        You can define height and width using any of the units we
        just went over.
    </p>

    <p>
        Also, it may be weird that height and width can't be set in an inlined element.
        It actually makes a lot of sense though. The whole point of inline is to take
        up the least amount of space possible so if you're just going to set the
        width and height, what's the point?
    </p>
    
    <hr>

    <div style="background-color: darksalmon;">
        <p>I've put all tags for the next two styles in a div so you can see them better</p>
        <p style="margin: 60px;">
            3. Margin: Increases the size of the tag from the outisde. Here's 60px.
            I'm going to set the margin of the hr tags to 0 so you can see it better and don't
            get the default margin of the hr tags mixed up with the margin of the p tags.
        </p>
        <hr style="margin: 0;">
        <p style="margin: 20px 200px;">
        You can also control the vertical margin seprate from the horizontal margin.
        Here's 20px vertical and 200px horizontal.
        </p>
        <hr style="margin: 0;">
        <p style="margin: 20px 40px 60px 150px;">
            You can also control the margin above, below, left and right individually.
            Here's 20px above, 40px to the right, 60px below and 150px to the left.
        </p>
        <hr style="margin: 0;">
        <p style="margin-left: 50px;">If you just wanted to change the margin in one direction, you can just write
            "margin-" and then the direction you want. Here's 50px to margin-left. As you can see, the paragraph tag
            has some margin by default so by only only changing the margin in the left direction, the margin
            for the other three directions stay as the default value for the paragraph tag.
        </p>
        
        <hr style="margin: 0;">
        <br>
        <hr style="margin: 0;">
        
        <p style="padding: 60px;">
            4. Padding: Increases the size of the tag from the inside. Here's 60px.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p style="padding: 20px 200px;">
        You can also control the vertical padding seprate from the horizontal padding.
        Here's 20px vertical and 200px horizontal.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p style="padding: 20px 40px 60px 150px;">
            You can also control the padding above, below, left and right individually.
            Here's 20px above, 40px to the right, 60px below and 150px to the left.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p style="padding: 50px;">If you just wanted to change the margin in one direction, you can just write
            "padding-" and then the direction you want. Here's 50px to margin-left.
        </p>

        <p>Also remember that margin and padding take in lengths with units so any of the units we went over will
            also work with margin and padding.</p>

    </div>

    <hr>

    <p>
        5. Border: This simply sets attributes of the border around a tag.
        By default on most tags, there's no border so we'll bring one up to show
        you what they look like.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p style="font-style: italic;">style: </p>

    <p>
        First we need to select the thickness of the border.
        This will take a number with units so like I said before,
        all units will work but we'll stick with pixels.
    </p>

    <p style="font-style: italic;">style: 5px</p>   

    <p>
        Now we need to set the style of the border. A border can
        style is very simular to a text-decoration style. A list of possible
        styles are the following.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Dotted</li>
        <li>Dashed</li>
        <li>Solid</li>
        <li>Double</li>
        <li>groove</li>
        <li>ridge</li>
        <li>inset</li>
        <li>outset</li>
        <li>none (meaning that there is no border)</li>
        <li>hidden (meaning the border takes up space but is invisable)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        I rarely use anything other than the solid border so I'm going to
        stick with that one for now but you can check out
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp">this site here</a>
        to see a short description of each border along with what they look like.
    </p>

    <p style="font-style: italic;">style: 5px solid</p>

    <p>Now the last thing we need to do is set the color of the border and we're done.</p>

    <p style="font-style: italic;
    border: 5px solid darkblue;">
    style: 5px solid darkblue</p>

    <p>I'll show you a few quick combinations of borders you can make with this.</p>

    <ol>
        <li style="border: 4px inset lightcoral;margin-bottom: 15px;">
            4px inset lightcoral
        </li>
        <li style="border: 10px dotted cyan;margin-bottom: 15px;">10px dotted cyan</li>
        <li style="border: 6px ridge grey;margin-bottom: 15px;">6px ridge grey</li>
        <li style="border: 15px double green;margin-bottom: 15px;">15px double green</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        You can also set side of the border to a different border using
        "border-" and the direction you want. Very simular to padding
        and margin.
    </p>

    <p style="border-top: 5px dotted blue;">border-top: 5px dotted blue</p>

    <p>
        You can also set each style individually. Very simular to
        text decoration and Font.
    </p>

    <p style="
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: groove;
    border-color: chocolate;
    ">
        border-width: 10px, border-style: groove and border-color: chocolate;
    </p>

    <p>
        You can also define a single attribute in three differnet ways
        which I'll go over with an example where I define width, style
        and color all using the different methods.
    </p>

    <p style=" 
    /* this defines the the width of each side of the border
    in order of top, right, bottom and left (clockwise from the top) */
    border-width: 5px 10px 5px 8px;

    /* this defines the style for the top and bottom first, then
    it defines the style for the left and right. */
    border-style: ridge solid;

    /* This defines the color of each side of the border individuality */
    border-right-color: red;
    border-bottom-color: yellow;
    border-left-color: green;
    border-top-color: blue;
    ">
        The first and second way are definitely the best way of defining
        each side of a border indivually but if you can't remember or don't
        understand how it works, the last method should be clear and easy to remember.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p>
        Now we're going to talk about two more styles and we're done.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">
        6. Text Align: let's you align the text within a non-inline element.
        The possible ways you can align a the text in a non-inline element is the following.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li style="text-align: left;">text-align: left (default)</li>
        <li style="text-align: right;">text-align: right</li>
        <li style="text-align: center;">text-align: center</li>
        <li style="text-align: justify;">
            text-align: justify (though it may look simular to "text-align: left" at first, you may notice 
            that if we add enough text to it and set it to "text-align: justify", it'll actually make
            sure that each line ends at exactly the end of the screen unless it can't make it the the edge of the
            screen. This is similar to the effect of a newpaper heading.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Now you may have noticed that I said it only works for non-inline elements.
        This is for a simular reason the height and width. (also, if your curious
        about how the styles are working, CSS reads linearly so you can
        over write values after setting them in the code if you'd like to do so)
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;border: 3px solid brown;border-color: brown blue;">
        In a block element, it takes up as much of the
        width of the screen it can get so the text inside has
        a lot of freedom to move.
    </p>

    <div><span style="text-align: center;border: 3px solid brown;border-color: brown blue;">
        In an inline element, it tries to be as small as possible
        so the text can't move around at all. causing text-align to be useless.
    </span></div>

    <hr>

    <p>
        7. Float: moves the floated element to the top of it's container,
        then it moves to one side and finally forces elements to go on
        the other side of it. Let's do a few examples.
    </p>

    <span style="float: right; border: 3px solid green;">
        Here is what happends when I set a span to float right.
    </span>

    <p style="border: 6px solid yellow;">
        It may have looked normal at first but as you can see from this
        paragraph tag which should've taken up the enitre width of the screen by
        default now aims to swerve all text inside of it around the floated
        element. This is what float does.
    </p>

    <div style="float: right; border: 3px solid green;font-size: small;">
        Here is what happends when I set a div to float right.
    </div>
    
    <p style="border: 6px solid yellow;">
        You may also notice that if I do everything the exact same as the last
        one instead of a span tag (inline-element), we use a div (block-element),
        it does the exact same thing. This is because when we set teh float value
        of an element, it starts to act differently from what it's display is set to.
    </p>

    <p>
        The big diffence between a regular block element and block element
        which has been floated is if the block element doesn't have
        a specified width, will act like an inline element.
    </p>

    <p>
        in other words, by default, a floated block-element will take up
        the least amount of space possible which is completly against all that a
        block element is.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you do want to have a speified width though, you must use
        a div element becauseinline elements still won't let you chnage the
        height and width so that's the main difference beween a floated block-element
        and a float inline-element
    </p>

    <p>Float has three main options</p>

    <ol>
        <li>left</li>
        <li>right</li>
        <li>none (default</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        There's also a style called "clear" which negates the effects of float
        but we won't talk about that here. If you'd like to know more about float
        and clear or maybe it still doesn't make a lot of sense,
        <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/float/">this site</a>
        does an amazing job at exaplaining both of these very well.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p>
        This concludes the basics of styles. Next, wlll go over a few more HTML tags
        as well as different ways to classify and id different tags within HTML.
        Good luck and have fun.
